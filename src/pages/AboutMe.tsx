                I'm a full time coder that tries to make a custom hobby-blog
                with zero experience in journalism.

            <h1>Motive</h1>
            <p>
                After a long journey inside my head I came in conclusion
                that I would like to practice a certain set of skills.
                Those skills are Journalism, Graphic Design and coding skills on styling.

                But as a normal human being that I am, procrastination is my best friend :love:.
            </p>

            <p>
                And what's best motive to accomplish these goals than throwing yourself out there
                and making yourself accountable to the public?

            </p>
            <p>
                So, this blog page will be a great way to practice all of them in the eyes of the public.
                Hopefully I will inspire you to follow dreams without thinking too much about what the
                world says, by seeing my marvelous, horrifying, slow or idiotic process of this blog.

                I am rooting for anyone who tries to accomplish anything.
            </p>
